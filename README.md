# FreeCAD-Behave-dark
Behave dark theme for FreeCAD

Customized from Pablogil's awesome stylesheets [here](https://github.com/pgilfernandez/FreeCAD_stylesheets).

Full port of the [Behave theme](https://github.com/fnky/behave-theme) by Christian Petersen. 

For full effect set your background color to #2C333D. Find all the fitting "possible" colors in the "ApprovedColors.txt" file. These are mostly pulled straight out of the original [Behave theme](https://github.com/fnky/behave-theme)

Still figuring out how to set the sketcher colors etc.

How to install
------
- ~~Close FreeCAD~~
- ~~Take the *.qss file and paste it in the following location depending on your OS:~~
    - ~~__Windows__ - FreeCADInstallationPath/data/Gui/Stylesheets/~~
    - ~~__Linux__ - /home/YourUsername/.FreeCAD/Gui/Stylesheets/~~
    - ~~__OSX__ - /Users/YourUsername/Library/Preferences/FreeCAD/Gui/Stylesheets/~~
- ~~Open FreeCAD~~
- ~~Go to "Edit", "Preferences", "General" and choose your stylesheet in the dropdown menu~~

~~You can also create a hardlink from your cloned repo location to that path so you can update the stylesheet with a git pull.~~

__This has been merged into the FreeCAD core. Starting from commit [f686ed](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/commit/f686ed16e58f669026462445691badc59f5ca23b) you should already have it. Found bugs in this stylesheet will still be developed here for now.__
